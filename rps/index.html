            My name is Jessica Del Grande, and I'm a versatile web engineer and
            communications professional with over eight years of experience
            developing impactful online solutions for FinTech and Fortune 500
            companies. My professional journey began in marketing management,
            where I spent more than a decade honing my skills in digital

            I bring a unique perspective to Regina Police Service by combining
            hands-on web development expertise with digital marketing strategy,
            data analysis, and UX principles. This multi-faceted foundation
            allows me to bridge the gap between the technical and the
            non-technical, the jargon-filled documentation and the casual
            conversation, to get buy-in from stakeholders and engagement from
            users and the community.

          <p class="rps__text">
            The Regina Police Service website serves as a critical communication
            bridge between the police service and the community. In an era where
            police services face increased public scrutiny, the website presents
            a valuable opportunity to demonstrate transparency, accessibility,
            and community commitment.
          </p>
          <p class="rps__text">
            I have identified several strategic opportunities that will enhance
            user experience while reinforcing the RPS's dedication to serving
            all community members effectively.
          </p>
          <p class="rps__text">
            Police services across Canada are navigating increased public
            attention regarding budget allocation and community safety
            approaches. The RPS website can play a pivotal role in demonstrating
            value to taxpayers by showcasing transparency, diverse response
            tactics, and community engagement.
          </p>
          <p class="rps__text">
            A well-designed, accessible website reflects the organization's core
            values of Respectful Professional Service and commitment to serving
            all residents of Regina.

              1. Brand Consistency & Visual Identity
            </summary>
            <p class="rps__text">
              Current Challenge: The website currently uses multiple fonts and
              varying design elements that create a fragmented user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="rps__text">Recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Standardize typography to one primary font (Roboto, already
                designated as the primary font in website variables)
              </li>
              <li>
                Remove the current Antonio font, which presents accessibility
                challenges due to its narrow letterforms that can blur together
                and create uniform word shapes
              </li>
              <li>
                Implement a consistent border radius system throughout the site
              </li>
              <li>
                Establish a slightly expanded color palette using monochromatic
                or analogous colors, to maintain the authority and integrity of
                the existing RPS brand while adding depth and visual texture
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluate adherence to linguistic style guides and ensure
                consistent terminology and spelling are used throughout (e.g.
                re-imagined vs reimagined)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="rps__text">
              Impact: Consistent branding reinforces professionalism and

              Current Challenge: Several accessibility barriers can prevent some
              community members from effectively accessing information.

            <p class="rps__text">Improvements Needed:</p>

                Ensure all links are clearly identifiable with underlines or
                other visual indicators
              </li>
              <li>
                Improve font readability for users with vision impairments,
                reading disabilities, and older adults
              </li>
              <li>
                Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit to ensure compliance
                with WCAG and ACA standards

              Current Challenge: The vast amount of data collected by RPS could
              better serve the dual purpose of informing the public and
              demonstrating police effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p class="rps__text">Strategic Opportunities:</p>
            <ul>
